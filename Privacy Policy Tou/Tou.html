<h2>"AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" Disclaimer</h2>
<p>The Service is provided to You "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all faults and defects without warranty of any kind. <br> To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates <br> and its and their respective licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, <br> implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Service, including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness <br> for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of <br> performance, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or <br>undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended <br>results, be compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems or services, operate without interruption, <br>meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.</p>
<p>Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the company's provider makes any representation or <br>warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the Service, or the information, <br>content, and materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to <br>the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any information or content provided through the Service; or (iv) that the <br>Service, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent from or on behalf of the Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan <br>horses, worms, malware, timebombs or other harmful components.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable statutory <br> rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You. But in such a case the <br>exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable under <br>applicable law.</p>
<h2>Governing Law</h2>
<p>The laws of the Country, excluding its conflicts of law rules, shall govern this Terms and Your use of the Service. <br> Your use of the Application may also be subject to other local, state, national, or international laws.</p>
<h2>Disputes Resolution</h2>
<p>If You have any concern or dispute about the Service, You agree to first try to resolve the dispute informally by <br> contacting the Company.</p>
<h2>For European Union (EU) Users</h2>
<p>If You are a European Union consumer, you will benefit from any mandatory provisions of the law of the country in which <br> you are resident in.</p>
<h2>United States Legal Compliance</h2>
<p>You represent and warrant that (i) You are not located in a country that is subject to the United States government <br>embargo, or that has been designated by the United States government as a "terrorist supporting" country, and (ii) You are <br>not listed on any United States government list of prohibited or restricted parties.</p>
<h2>Severability and Waiver</h2>
<h3>Severability</h3>
<p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted <br> to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the remaining <br>provisions will continue in full force and effect.</p>
<h3>Waiver</h3>
<p>Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an obligation under these Terms <br>shall not effect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such performance at any time thereafter nor shall <br>the waiver of a breach constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.</p>
<h2>Translation Interpretation</h2>
<p>These Terms and Conditions may have been translated if We have made them available to You on our Service. <br>
You agree that the original English text shall prevail in the case of a dispute.</p>
